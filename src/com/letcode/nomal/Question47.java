/**
 * Shaka and his brother have created a boring game which is played like this:
 *
 * They take a word composed of lowercase English letters and try to get the maximum possible score by building exactly 2 palindromic subsequences. The score obtained is the product of the length of these 2 subsequences.
 *
 * Let's say  and  are two subsequences from the initial string. If  &  are the smallest and the largest positions (from the initial word) respectively in  ; and  &  are the smallest and the largest positions (from the initial word) respectively in , then the following statements hold true:
 * ,
 * , &
 * .
 * i.e., the positions of the subsequences should not cross over each other.
 *
 * Hence the score obtained is the product of lengths of subsequences  & . Such subsequences can be numerous for a larger initial word, and hence it becomes harder to find out the maximum possible score. Can you help Shaka and his brother find this out?
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * Input contains a word  composed of lowercase English letters in a single line.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 *
 * each character will be a lower case english alphabet.
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Output the maximum score the boys can get from .
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * eeegeeksforskeeggeeks
 * Sample Output
 *
 * 50
 * Explanation
 *
 * A possible optimal solution is eee-g-ee-ksfor-skeeggeeks being
 * eeeee the one subsequence and skeeggeeks the other one. We can also select eegee in
 * place of eeeee, as both have the same length.
